<h2>MR. PUNCH AT THE HELM!</h2>

<center>(<i>By way of Introduction</i>)</center>

<p>River and sea, with their teeming summer life as we know them in Great
Britain and around our coasts, have yielded a rich supply of subjects
for the pens and pencils of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> merry men. In Stevenson's famous
story of "The Merry Men," it is the cruel side of the sea that is
symbolised under that ironic description; but there is no touch of gall,
no sinister undertone, in the mirth of <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> "merry men."</p>

<p>It may be protested that in the pages of this little book, where we have
brought together for the first time all <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> "happy thoughts"
about boating and sailing, the miseries of travel by sea and the
discomforts of holiday life on our inland waters are too much insisted
upon. But it is as much the function of the humorist as it is the
business of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a> </span> philosopher to hold the mirror up to nature, and we are
persuaded that it is no distorted mirror in which <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> shows us to
ourselves.</p>

<p>After all, although as a nation we are proud to believe that Britannia
rules the waves, and to consider ourselves a sea-going people, for the
most of us our recollections of Channel passages and trips around our
coasts are inevitably associated with memories of <i>mal-de-mer</i>, and it
says much for our national good humour that we can turn even our
miseries into jest.</p>

<p>Afloat or ashore, <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> is never "at sea," and while his jokes have
always their point, that point is never barbed, as these pages
illustrative of the humours of boating and sailing&mdash;with <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> at
the helm&mdash;may be left safely to bear witness.</p>

<p class="i2">With a stror 'at and <i>puggeree</i>, Charlie, low shoes and new mulberry gloves.</p>
<p class="i2">If I didn't jest fetch our two gals, it's a pity;&mdash;and wasn't they loves?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">We'd three chaps in the boat besides me,&mdash;jest a nice little party of six,</p>
<p class="i2">But they didn't get arf a look in 'long o' me; they'd no form, them two sticks.</p>
<p class="i2">If you'd seen me a settin' and steerin' with one o' the shes on each side,</p>
<p class="i2">You'd a thought me a Turk in check ditters, and looked on your 'Arry with pride.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Wy, we see a swell boat with three ladies, sech rippers, in crewel and buff,</p>
<p class="i2">(If <i>I</i> pulled arf a 'our in their style it 'ud be a bit more than enough)</p>
<p class="i2">Well, I tipped 'em a wink as we passed and sez, "Go it, my beauties, well done!"</p>
<p class="i2">And, oh lor! if you'd twigged 'em blush up you'd a seen 'ow they relished the fun.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">I'm dead filberts, my boy, on the river, it ain't to be beat for a lark.</p>
<p class="i2">And the gals as goes boating, my pippin, is jest about "'Arry, his mark."</p>
<p class="i2">If you want a good stare, you can always run into 'em&mdash;accident quite!</p>
<p class="i2">And they carn't charge yer nothink for looking, nor put you in quod for the fright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">'Ow we chivied the couples a-spoonin', and bunnicked old fishermen's swims,</p>
<p class="i2">And put in a Tommy Dodd Chorus to Methodys practisin' hymns!</p>
<p class="i2">Then we pic-nic'd at last on the lawn of a waterside willa. Oh, my!</p>
<p class="i2">When the swells see our bottles and bits, I've a notion some language'll fly.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">It was on the Q. T., in a nook snugged away in a lot of old trees,</p>
<p class="i2">I sat on a bust of Apoller, with one of the gurls on my knees!</p>
<p class="i2">Cheek, eh? Well, the fam'ly was out, and the servants asleep, I suppose;</p>
<p class="i2">For they didn't 'ear even our roar, when I chipped orf the himage's nose.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">We'd soon emptied our three-gallon bottle, and Tommy he pulled a bit wild,</p>
<p class="i2">And we blundered slap into a skiff, and wos jolly near drownding a child.</p>
<p class="i2">Of course we bunked off in the scurry, and showed 'em a clean pair o' legs,</p>
<p class="i2">Pullin' up at a waterside inn where we went in for fried 'am and eggs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">We kep that 'ere pub all-alive-oh, I tell yer, with song and with chorus,</p>
<p class="i2">To the orful disgust of some prigs as wos progging two tables afore us.</p>
<p class="i2">I do 'ate your hushabye sort-like, as puts on the fie-fie at noise.</p>
<p class="i2">'Ow on earth can yer spree without shindy? It's jest wot a feller enjoys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Quaker-meetings be jiggered, I say; if you're 'appy, my boy, give it tongue.</p>
<p class="i2">I tell yer we roused 'em a few, coming 'ome, with the comics we sung.</p>
<p class="i2">Hencoring a prime 'un, I somehow forgot to steer straight, and we fouled</p>
<p class="i2">The last 'eat of a race&mdash;such a lark! Oh, good lor', <i>'ow</i> they chi-iked and 'owled!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">There was honly one slight <i>country-tong</i>, Tommy Blogg, who's a bit of a hass,</p>
<p class="i2">Tried to splash a smart pair of swell "spoons" by some willers we 'appened to pass;</p>
<p class="i2">And the toff ketched the blade of Tom's scull, dragged 'im close, and jest landed 'im <i>one</i>!</p>
<p class="i2">Arter which Master Tom nussed his eye up, and seemed rayther out of the fun.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Sez the toff, "You're the pests of the river, you cads!" Well, I didn't reply,</p>
<p class="i2">'Cos yer see before gals, it ain't nice when a feller naps one in the eye;</p>
<p class="i2">But it's all bloomin' nonsense, my boy! If he'd only jest give <i>me</i> a look,</p>
<p class="i2">He'd a seen as <i>my</i> form was O.K., as I fancy ain't easy mistook.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Besides, I suppose as the river is free to all sorts, 'igh and low.</p>
<p class="i2">That I'm sweet on true swells you're aweer, but for stuck-ups I don't care a blow.</p>
<p class="i2">We'd a rare rorty time of it, Charlie, and as for that younger gurl, Carry,</p>
<p class="i2">I'll eat my old boots if she isn't dead-gone on</p>

<p>And so they sat in the boat and looked into one another's eyes, and
found much to read in them. They ignored the presence of the houseboats,
and scarcely remembered that there were such things as launches
propelled by steam or electricity. And they turned deaf ears to the
niggers, and did not want their fortunes told by dirty females of a
gipsy type.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a> </span></p>

<p>"This is very pleasant," said Edwin.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" replied Angelina; "and it's such a good place for seeing all
the events."</p>

<p>"Admirable!" and they talked of other things; and the time sped on, and
the dark shadows grew, and still they talked, and talked, and talked.</p>

<p>At length the lanterns on the river began to glow, and Henley put on its
best appearance, and broke out violently into fireworks. It was then
Mrs. Grundy spied them out. She had been on the look out for scandal all
day long, but could find none. This seemed a pleasant and promising
case.</p>

<p>"So you are here!" she exclaimed. "Why, we thought you must have gone
long ago! And what do you say of the meeting?"</p>

<p>"A most perfect success," said he.</p>

<p>"And the company?"</p>

<p>"Could not be more charming," was her reply.</p>

<p>"And what did you think of the racing?" Then they looked at one another
and smiled. They spoke together, and observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, we did not think of the racing!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Grundy was not altogether satisfied.</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON THE RIVER</h2>

<a href="images/i_029.png">
<img src="images/i_029.png" width="100%" alt="ROBERT" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was ony a week or so ago as I was engaged perfeshnally on board a
steam Yot that had been hired for about as jolly a party as I ewer
remembers to have had on board a ship, and the Forreners among 'em had
ewidently been brort for to see what a reel lovely River the Tems is. I
must say I was glad to get away from Town, as I 'ad 'ad a shock from
seeing a something dreadful on an old showcard outside of the Upraw
which they tells me is now given up to Promenades. So we started from
Skindel's, at Madenhed Bridge, and took 'em right up to Gentlemanly
Marlow, and on to old Meddenham, and then to Henley, and lots of other
butiful places, and then back to Skindel's to dinner. And a jolly nice
little dinner they guv us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a> </span> and sum werry good wine, as our most
critical gests&mdash;and we had two Corporation gents among 'em&mdash;couldn't
find not no fault with. But there's sum peeple as it ain't not of no use
to try to sattisfy with butiful seenery&mdash;at least, not if they bees
Amerrycains. They don't seem not to have the werry least hadmiration or
respect for anythink as isn't werry big, and prefur size to buty any day
of the week.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a nice-looking little stream enuff," says an Amerrycain, who
was a board a grinnin; "but it's really quite a joke to call it a River.
Why, in my country," says he, "if you asked me for to show you a River,
I should take you to Mrs. Sippy's, and when we got about harf way across
it, I guess you'd see a reel River then, for it's so wide that you
carn't see the land on either side of it, so you sees nothink else but
the River, and as that's what you wanted for to see, you carn't werry
well grumble then." I shood, most suttenly, have liked for to have asked
him, what sort of Locks they had in sitch a River as that, and whether
Mrs. Sippy cort many wales when she went out for a day's fishing in that
little River<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a> </span> of hers, but I knows my place, and never asks inconvenient
questions.</p>

<p>However, he was a smart sort of feller, and had 'em I must say werry
nicely indeed a few minutes arterwards. We was a passing a werry butiful
bit of the river called a Back Water, and he says, says he, "As it's so
preshus hot in the sun, why don't we run in there and enjoy the shade
for a time, while we have our lunch?" "Oh," says one of the marsters of
the feast, "we are not allowed to go there; that's privet, that is."
"Why how can that be?" says he, "when you told me, just now, as you'd
lately got a Hact of Parliament passed which said that wherever Tems
Water flowed it was open to all the world, as of course it ort to be."
"Ah," said the other, looking rayther foolish, "but this is one of the
xceptions, for there's another claws in the hact as says that wherever
any body has had a hobstruction in the River for 20 years it belongs to
him for hever, but he musn't make another nowheres."</p>

<p>The Amerrycain grinned as before, and said, "Well, I allers said as you
was about the rummiest lot of people on the face of the airth, and this
is on'y another proof of it. You are so werry fond of everythink as is
old, that if a man can show as he has had a cussed noosance for twenty
years, he may keep it coz he's had it so long, while all sensible peeple
must think, as that's one more reeson for sweeping the noosance clean
away." And I must say, tho he was a Amerrycane, that I coodn't help
thinking as he was right.</p>

<p>It's estonishing what a remarkabel fine happy-tight a run on the butiful
Tems seems to give heverybody, and wot an adwantage we has in that
partickler respect over the poor Amerycans who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a> </span> gos for a trip on Mrs.
Sippy's big River, with the wind a bloing like great guns, and the waves
a dashing mountings hi. But on our butiful little steamer on our luvly
little river, altho the gests had most suttenly all brekfasted afore
they cum, why we hadn't started much about half-a-nour, afore three or
fore on 'em came creeping down into the tite little cabin and asking for
jest a cup of tea and a hegg or two, and a few shrimps; and, in less
than a nour arterwards, harf a duzzen more on 'em had jest a glass or
two of wine and a sandwich, and all a arsking that most important of all
questions on bord a Tems Yot, "What time do we lunch?" And by 2 a clock
sharp they was all seated at it, and pegging away at the Sammon and the
pidgin pie, het settera, as if they was harf-starved, and ewen arter
that, the butiful desert and the fine old Port Wine was left upon the
table, and I can troothfully state that the cabin was never wunce quite
empty till we was again doing full justice to Mr. Skindel's <i>maynoo</i>.</p>

<h2>HINTS FOR HENLEY</h2>

<center>(<i>At the Service of Visitors wishing to be comfortable</i>)</center>

<p>Take care to be invited to the best situated houseboat.</p>

<p>If you can, get permission to ask a few friends to join your host's
party at luncheon.</p>

<p>Be sure to secure the pleasantest seat, the most amusing neighbour, and
all the periodicals.</p>

<p>If you are conversationally inclined, monopolise the talk, and if you
are not, plead a headache for keeping every one silent.</p>

<p>Mind that "No. 1" is your particular numerical distinction, and that the
happiness of the rest of the world is a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>If you are a man, keep smoking cigars and sipping refreshing beverages
until it is time to eat and drink seriously; if you are of the other
sex, flirt, chatter, or sleep, as the impulse moves you.</p>

<p>And when you are quite, <i>quite</i> sure that you have nothing better to do,
give a glance to the racing!</p>

<h2>HOW TO ENJOY LIFE ON THE RIVER</h2>

<p>Get a houseboat and be sure that it is water-tight and free from rats
and other unpleasant visitors.</p>

<p>Take care that your servants have no objection to roughing it, and can
turn their hands to anything usually supplied in town by the stores.</p>

<p>Accustom yourself to food in tins and bottles, and learn to love insects
with or without wings.</p>

<p>Acclimatise yourself to mists and fogs and rainy days, and grow
accustomed to reading papers four days old and the advertisements of
out-of-date railway guides.</p>

<p>Try to love the pleasures of a regatta. Do not quarrel with the riparian
owners or the possessors of other houseboats. Enjoy the pleasantries of
masked musicians, and take an intelligent interest in the racing.
Illuminate freely, and do your best to avoid a fire or an explosion. And
if you have fireworks, don't sort them out with the light of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a> </span> blazing
squib or some illuminant of a similar character.</p>

<p>Be good, and mild and long-suffering. Rest satisfied with indifferently
cooked food, damp sheets, and wearisome companions. And make the best of
storms of rain and hurricanes of wind. In fact, bear everything, and
grin when you can't laugh.</p>

<p><i>Another and a better way.</i>&mdash;Put up at a comfortable riparian hotel, and
when the weather is against you, run up to town and give a wide berth to
the Thames and its miseries.</p>

<h2>NAUTICAL MAN&OElig;UVRES</h2>

<center>(<i>Described by a Landlubber</i>)</center>

<p><i>Sailing in the Wind's Eye.</i>&mdash;In order to accomplish this difficult
man&oelig;uvre, you must first of all discover where the wind's eye is, and
then, if it be practicable, you may proceed to sail in it. It is
presumed for this purpose that the wind's eye is a "liquid" one.</p>

<p><i>Hugging the Shore.</i>&mdash;When you desire to hug the shore, you first of all
must land on it. Then take some sand and shingle in your arms, and give
it a good hug. In doing this, however, be careful no one sees you, or
the result of the man&oelig;uvre may be a strait-waistcoat.</p>

<p><i>Wearing a Ship.</i>&mdash;This it is by no means an easy thing to do, and it is
difficult to suggest what will make it easier. Wearing a chignon is
preposterous enough, but when a man is told that he must wear a ship, he
would next expect to hear that he must eat the Monument.</p>

<p><i>Boxing the Compass.</i>&mdash;Assume a fighting attitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a> </span> and hit the compass
a "smart stinger on the dial-plate," as the sporting papers call it. But
before you do so, you had best take care to have your boxing-gloves on,
or you may hurt your fingers.</p>

<p><i>Whistling for a Wind.</i>&mdash;When you whistle for a wind, you should choose
an air appropriate, such as "<i>Blow, gentle gales</i>," or "<i>Winds, gently
whisper</i>."</p>

<p><i>Reefing the Lee-scuppers.</i>&mdash;First get upon a reef, and then put your
lee-scuppers on it. The man&oelig;uvre is so simple, that no more need be
said of it.</p>

<p><i>Splicing the Main-brace.</i>&mdash;When your main-brace comes in pieces, get a
needle and thread and splice it. If it be your custom to wear a pair of
braces, you first must ascertain which of them <i>is</i> your main one.</p>

<h2>WHAT NO ONE SHOULD FORGET, IN CROSSING THE CHANNEL</h2>

<p>To place his rugs, carpet-bags, and umbrellas on the six best seats on
the boat.</p>

<p>To worry the captain with remarks about the state of the weather and the
performance of the steamer: to observe to the steward that there is a
change in the weather, and that there were more passengers the last time
he crossed.</p>

<p>To speak to the man at the wheel, and ask him whether there was much sea
on last trip.</p>

<p>To change his last half-crown into French money, and squabble with the
steward as to the rate of exchange.</p>

<p>To stare at his neighbours, read aloud their names on their luggage, and
remark audibly that he'll lay anything the lady with the slight twang is
an American.</p>

<p>To repeat the ancient joke on "Back her! stop her!"</p>

<p>If the passage is rough, to put his feet on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a> </span> neighbour's head, after
appropriating all the cushions in the cabin.</p>

<p>To call for crockery in time. N.B.&mdash;Most important.</p>

<p>To groan furiously for an hour and a half, if a sufferer; or, if utterly
callous to waves and their commotions, to eat beef and ham, and drink
porter and brandy-and-water, during the entire voyage, with as much
clattering of forks and noise of mastication as is compatible with
enjoyment.</p>

<p>To kiss his hand, on entering the harbour, to the <i>matelottes</i> on the
quays, or send his love in bad French to the Prefect of Police.</p>

<p>To struggle for a front place, in crowding off the steamer, as if the
ship was on fire. And finally&mdash;</p>

<p>To answer every one who addresses him in good English in the worst
possible French.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What with the horse-boats," said Mrs. Ramsbotham, "the steam-lunches,
the condolers, the out-ragers, the Canadian caboose, and the banyans, we
had the greatest difficulty, at Henley, in getting from one side of the
river to the other."</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the songs of Dibdin had a wonderful effect
on the courage of the Navy, and there is no doubt that the Ben Blocks,
Ben Backstays, Tom Tackles, and Tom Bowlings, were, poetically speaking,
the fathers of our Nelsons, our Howes, our St. Vincents, and our
Codringtons. It will be the effort of <i>Punch's Naval Songster</i> to do for
the Thames what Dibdin did for the Sea, and to inspire with courage
those honest-hearted fellows who man the steamers on the river. If we
can infuse a little spirit into them&mdash;which, by the bye, they greatly
want&mdash;our aim will be fully answered.</p>

<h2>"SIC TRANSIT&mdash;&mdash;"</h2>

<p>Just starting down Southampton Water in jolly old Bigheart's yacht, <i>The
Collarbone</i>&mdash;or <i>Columbine</i>? I wonder which it is? Dear old Bigheart,
the best fellow in the world, and enthusiastic about yachting. So am I
(theoretically, and whilst in smooth water). Try to act as nautically as
possible, and ask skipper at frequent intervals "How does she bear?"
Don't know what it means; but, after all, what <i>does</i> that matter?
Skipper stares at me rather helplessly, and mutters something about
"Nothe-nor-east-by-sou-sou-west." Feel that, with this lucid
explanation, I ought to be satisfied, so turn away, assume cheery aspect
and with a rolling gait seize the topsail-main-gaff-mizen sheet and pull
it lustily, with a "Yo, heave ho!"</p>

<p>The pull, unfortunately, releases heavy block, which, falling on
Bigheart's head, seems to quite annoy him for the minute. We plunge into
Solent, and then bear away for West Channel. Skipper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a> </span> remarks that we
shall make a long "retch" of it (<i>absit omen</i>). He then adds that we
could "bring up"&mdash;why these unpleasantly suggestive nautical
expressions?&mdash;off Yarmouth. Not wishing to appear ignorant, I ask
Bigheart, "Why not make a course S.S. by E.?" He replies, "Because it
would take us ashore into the R. V. Yacht Club garden," and I retire
somewhat abashed.</p>

<p>Out in West Channel we get into what skipper calls "a bit of a bobble."
Don't think I care quite so much for yachting in "bobbles." Bigheart
shows me all the varied beauties of the coast, but now they fail to
interest me. He says, "I say, we'll keep sailing until quite late this
evening, eh? That'll be jolly!" Reply, "Yes, that'll be jolly," but
somehow my voice lacks heartiness.</p>

<p>An hour later I was lying down&mdash;I felt tired&mdash;when Bigheart came up, and
with a ring of joy in his manly tones exclaimed, "I tell you what, old
man; we'll carry right on, now, through the night. We're not in a hurry,
so we'll get as much sailing as we can." ... Then, with my last ounce of
failing strength, I sat up and denounced him as an assassin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a> </span></p>

<p>After passing a night indescribable, lying on the shelf&mdash;I mean berth&mdash;I
was put ashore at Portland next morning. Should like to have procured
dear old Bigheart a government appointment there for seven years, as a
due reward for what he had been making me suffer.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<center>(<i>Extracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.</i>)</center>

<p><i>Gulf of Lyons, Friday.</i>&mdash;The casual traveller on Continental railways,
especially in France, is familiar with the official attitude towards the
hapless wayfarer. The leading idea is to make the journey as difficult
and as uncomfortable as possible. The plan is based on treatment of
parcels or baggage. The passenger is bundled about, shunted, locked up
in waiting-rooms, and finally delivered in a limp state at whatever hour
and whatsoever place may suit the convenience of the railway people.
Discover the same spirit dominant in management and arrangements of the
sea service. Steamer from Marseilles to Tunis advertised to sail to-day
at noon. On taking tickets, ordered to be on board at ten o'clock.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a> </span></p>

<p>Why two hours before starting? Gentleman behind counter shrugs his
shoulders, hugs his ribs with his elbows, holds out his hands with
deprecatory gesture and repeats, "<i>À dix heures, Monsieur</i>."</p>

<p>Gestures even more eloquent than speech. Plainly mean that unless we are
alongside punctually at ten o'clock our blood, or rather our passage,
will be on our own heads. Spoils a morning; might have gone about town
till eleven o'clock; breakfasted at leisure; sauntered on board a few
minutes before noon. However, when in Marseilles chant the
"<i>Marseillaise</i>."</p>

<p>Down punctually at ten; found boat in course of loading; decks full of
dirt and noise, the shouting of men, the creaking of the winch, the
rattling of the chains. Best thing to do is to find our cabin, stow away
our baggage, and walk on the quay, always keeping our eye on the boat
lest she should suddenly slip her moorings and get off to sea without
us. Look out for steward. Like the Spanish fleet, steward is not yet in
sight. Roaming about below, come upon an elderly lady, with a lame leg,
an alarming squint, and a waist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a> </span> like a ship's. (Never saw a ship's
waist, but fancy no mortal man could get his arm round it.) The elderly
lady, who displayed signs of asthma, tells me she is the stewardess. Ask
her where is our cabin. "<i>Voilà</i>," she says. Following the direction of
her glance, I make for a berth close by. Discover I had not made
allowance for the squint; she is really looking in another direction.
Carefully taking my bearings by this new light, I make for another
passage; find it blocked up; stewardess explains that they are loading
the ship&mdash;apparently through the floor of our cabin. "<i>Tout à l'heure</i>,"
she says, with comprehensive wave of the hand.</p>

<p>Nothing to be done but leave our baggage lying about, go on deck, and
watch the loading. Better not leave the ship. If the laborious Frenchmen
in blouses and perspiration see our trunks, they will certainly pop them
into the hold, where all kinds of miscellaneous parcels, cases and bales
are being chucked without the slightest attempt at fitting in.</p>

<p>A quarter to twelve; only fifteen minutes now; getting hungry; had
coffee and bread and butter early so as not to miss the boat. Watch a
man below in the hold trying to fit in a bicycle with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a> </span>
four-hundredweight bale, a quarter-ton case, and a barrel of cement.
Evidently piqued at resistance offered by the apparently frail,
defenceless contrivance. Tries to bend the fore wheel so as to
accommodate the cask; that failing, endeavours to wind the hind wheel
round the case; failing in both efforts, he just lays the bicycle loose
on the top of the miscellaneous baggage and the hatch is battened down.
In the dead unhappy night that followed, when the sea was on the deck, I
often thought of the bicycle cavorting to and fro over the serrated
ridge of the cargo.</p>

<p>Ten minutes to twelve; a savoury smell from the cook's galley. Suppose
<i>déjeuner</i> will be served as soon as we leave the dock. Heard a good
deal of superiority of French cooking aboard ship as compared with
British. Some compensation after all for getting up early, swallowing
cup of coffee and bread and butter, and rushing off to catch at ten
o'clock a ship that sails at noon. Perhaps the cloth is laid now; better
go and secure places. Find saloon. Captain and officers at breakfast,
their faces illumined with the ecstasy born to a Frenchman when he finds
an escargot on his plate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a> </span></p>

<p>Evidently they are breakfasting in good time so as to take charge of the
ship whilst <i>nous autres</i> succeed to the pleasures of the table. What's
our hour, I wonder? Find some one who looks like a steward; ask him;
says, "<i>Cinq heures et demie</i>." A little late that for breakfast, I
diffidently suggest. Explains not breakfast but dinner; first meal at
5.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Can't we have <i>déjeuner</i> if I pay for it? I ask,
ostentatiously shaking handful of coppers in trousers-pocket. No, he
says, severely; that's against the <i>règlement</i>.</p>

<p>Steamer starts in seven minutes; noticed at dock-gates women with
baskets of dubious food; dash off to buy some; clutch at a plate of
sandwiches, alleged to be compacted of <i>jambon de York</i>. Get back just
as gangway is drawn up. Sit on deck and munch our sandwiches. "I know
that Ham," said Sark, moodily. "It came out of the Ark."</p>

<p>Recommitted it to the waves, giving it the bearings for Ararat. Ate the
bread and wished half-past five or Blucher would come.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A lovely day in Marseilles; not a breath of wind stirred the blue water
that laved the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a> </span> cliffs on which Château d'If stands. Shall have a
lovely passage. Make ourselves comfortable on deck with cushions and
books. Scarcely outside the harbour when a wind sprang up from S.E. dead
ahead of us. The sea rose with amazing rapidity; banks of leaden-hued
clouds obscured the sun-light; then the rain swished down; saloon deck
cleared; passengers congregated under shelter in the saloon; as the
cranky little steamer rolled and pitched, the place emptied. When at
5.30 the dinner-bell rang, only six took their places, and all declined
soup. With the darkness the storm rose. If the ship could have made up
its mind either to roll or to pitch, it could have been endured. It had
an agonising habit of leaping up with apparent intent to pitch, and,
changing its mind, rolling over, groaning in every plank. Every third
minute the nose of the ship being under water, and the stern clear out,
the screw leaped full half-length in the air, sending forth
blood-curdling sounds. Midway came a fearsome crash of crockery, the
sound reverberating above the roar of the wind, and the thud of the
water falling by tons on the deck, making the ship quiver like a spurred
horse.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a> </span></p>

<p>"I begin to understand now," said Sark, "how the walls of Jericho fell."</p>

<p>Much trouble with the Generalissimo. When he came aboard at Marseilles
he suffused the ship with pleasing sense of the military supremacy of
Great Britain. Has seen more than seventy summers, but still walks with
sprightly step and head erect. The long droop of his carefully-curled
iron-grey moustache is of itself sufficient to excite terror in the
bosom of the foe. The Generalissimo has not the word retreat in his
vocabulary. He was one of the six who to-night sat at the dinner-table
and deftly caught scraps of meat and vegetable as the plates flew past.
But after dinner he collapsed. Thought he had retired to his berth;
towards nine o'clock a faint voice from the far end of the cabin led to
discovery of him prone on the floor, where he had been flung from one of
the benches. We got him up, replaced him tenderly on the bench, making a
sort of barricade on the offside with bolsters. A quarter of an hour
later the ship gave a terrible lurch to leeward; the screw hoarsely
shrieked; another batch of crockery crashed down; above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a> </span> uproar, a
faint voice was heard moaning, "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>We looked at the bench where we had laid the Generalissimo, his martial
cloak around him. Lo! he was not.</p>

<p>Guided by former experience, we found him under the table. Evidently no
use propping him up. So with the cushions we made a bed on the floor,
and the old warrior securely slept, soothed by the swish of the water
that crossed and recrossed the cabin floor as the ship rolled to leeward
or to starboard.</p>

<p>When the Generalissimo came aboard at Marseilles, surveying the
fortifications of the harbour as if he intended storming them, his
accent suggested that if not of foreign birth, he had lived long in
continental courts and camps. Odd to note how, as his physical
depression grew, an Irish accent softened his speech, till at length he
murmured of misery in the mellifluous brogue of County Cork.</p>

<p>Pretty to see the steward when the flood in the saloon got half a foot
deep ladle it out with a dustpan.</p>

<p><i>Tunis, Monday</i>, 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Just limped in here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a> </span> with deck cargo washed
overboard, bulwarks stove in, engine broken down, an awesome list to
port, galley so clean swept the cook doesn't know it, the cabins
flooded, and scarce a whole bit of crockery in the pantry. Twenty-one
hours late; not bad on a thirty-six-hours' voyage.</p>

<p>Captain comforts us with assurance that having crossed the Mediterranean
man and boy for forty years, he never went through such a storm. Have
been at sea a bit myself; only once, coasting in a small steamer off
Japan, have I seen&mdash;or, since it was in the main pitch dark,
felt&mdash;anything like it. Generalissimo turned up at dinner last night,
his moustache a little draggled, but his port once more martial. His
chief lament is, that going down to his berth yesterday morning, having
spent Friday night in the security of the saloon floor, he found his
boots full of water. This brings out chorus of heartrending experience.
Every cabin flooded; boxes and portmanteaus floating about. Sark and I
spent a more or less cosy night in the saloon. To us entered
occasionally one of the crew ostentatiously girt with a life-belt. Few
incidents so soothing on such a night. Fortunately, we did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a> </span> hear
till entering port how in the terror of the night two conscripts, bound
for Bizerta, jumped overboard and were seen no more.</p>

<p>"If this is the way they usually get to Tunis," says Sark, "I hope the
French will keep it all to themselves. In this particular case, there is
more in the Markiss's 'graceful concession' than meets the eye."</p>

<p><i>Fair.</i>&mdash;Yes; it is decidedly an improvement upon a railway carriage.
Room to move about. I don't in the least mind the eighty odd minutes. If
cold, you can put on a wrap, and there you are.</p>

<p><i>Change.</i>&mdash;Always thought there was something to be said in favour of
the Channel Tunnel. Of course, one likes to be patriotic, but the
movement in a choppy sea is the reverse of invigorating.</p>

<p><i>Wind.</i>&mdash;There should be a notice when a bad passage is expected. It's
all very well to describe this as "moderate," but that doesn't prevent
the beastly waves from running mountains high.</p>

<h2>LECTURES ON YACHTING</h2>

<center><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Aquarius Brick</span></center>

<p>We were present when the accomplished Professor Brick recently delivered
a series of lectures on yachting, which were very well attended. By his
kind permission, we have preserved bits of the discourses here and
there. We extract, <i>à discrétion</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I come now," went on the Professor, "to your most important
yachters&mdash;your genuine swells. Their cutters are in every harbour; you
trace their wake by empty champagne bottles on every sea. To such dandy
sea-kings I would now say one word.</p>

<p>"About your choice of cruising ground you cannot have much difficulty.
The Mediterranean is your proper spot. It is true that we will not
tolerate its being made a French lake&mdash;its proper vocation is that of
English pond!</p>

<p>"I would advise you all to be very particular in not letting your
'skipper' have too much authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a> </span> Remember always, that <i>you are the
owner</i>&mdash;high-spirited gentlemen do. Surely a man may sail his own yacht,
if anybody may! It is as much his property as his horse is. To be sure,
when the weather is very bad, I would let the fellow take charge then.
There is a very odd difference between the Bay of Biscay and the water
inside the Isle of Wight, when it blows. And a skipper <i>too much
snubbed</i> gets rusty at awkward times.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a> </span></p>

<p>"Your conduct in harbour will be regulated by circumstances&mdash;which
means, dinners. Generally speaking, the fact of having a yacht will
carry you everywhere. As every aëronaut is 'intrepid' by courtesy, so
every yachtsman is a 'fashionable arrival.' This great truth is scarcely
enough appreciated in England. I have known very worthy men spend in
trying to get into great society in London, sums which, judiciously
invested <i>in a yacht</i>, would have taken them to dozens of great people's
houses abroad. You will get asked to dinner; you will be feasted well,
generally. Anything in the way of excitement&mdash;particularly good, rich,
hospitable excitement&mdash;is heartily welcome in our colonial settlements
and stations.</p>

<p>"But I am not now speaking only to those who yacht, because to have a
yacht is a fine thing. I recognise also an imperial class of
yachtsmen&mdash;the swans of the flock of geese. I have seen a coronet on a
binnacle, before now. I have seen a large stately schooner sail into a
Mediterranean port&mdash;as into a drawing-room&mdash;splendid and serene. The
harbour-master's boat is on the alert these mornings. The men-of-war
send their boats to tow; the dandiest lieutenant goes in the barge; the
senior captain offers his services. When such a yacht as that goes into
the Golden Horn, the Sultan is shown to these yachters&mdash;like any
curiosity in his capital&mdash;like any odd thing in his town! They are
presented to him, as it is called, that <i>he</i> may be looked at.</p>

<p>"To this magnificent class I have not much to say. They don't snub their
skipper&mdash;they are far too fine to do that. They are scarcely distinctive
as travellers, for they are the same abroad as at home. In them, England
is represented. England floats in a lump through the sea, like Delos
used to do. As they say and do just the same as they have always said
and done at home&mdash;see and mix with the same kind of people&mdash;I often
wonder what they learn by it. When they go to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a> </span> Thermopylæ or
Marathon, it is with a lot of tents, donkeys, camp-stools,
travelling-cases, guides, and servants&mdash;such as Xerxes might have had.
They encumber the ruins of temples with the multitude of their baggage.
The position seems so unnatural, that I can't fancy their getting any
moral or intellectual profit from it. They are too well off for
that&mdash;like a fellow who cannot see for fat. Depend on it, you cannot see
much through a painted window, however fine it is."</p>

<p>Professor Brick concluded his first sketch amidst much applause.</p>

<h2>ON THE RIVER</h2>

<center>(<i>Page from the Diary of a Sweet Girl Clubbist</i>)</center>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Very pleased I have been chosen for the boat. So glad to have
been taken before Amy and Blanche. I am sure I shall look better than
either of them. They needn't have been so disagreeable about it. Amy
asking for her racquet back, and Blanche refusing to lend me her cloak
with the feather trimmings. Fanny should make a first-rate stroke, and
Kate a model coach.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;We were to have practice to-day, but postponed it to decide
on our colours. Blouses are to be left optional, but we are all to wear
the same caps. We had a terrible fight over it. Fanny, Rose and I are
blonde, so naturally we want light blue. Henrietta is a brunette, and
(selfish thing!) stood out for yellow! However, we settled it amicably
at last by choosing&mdash;as a compromise&mdash;pink. Then I made a capital
suggestion, which pleased everybody immensely. Instead of caps we are to
wear picture-hats.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Went out in our boat for the first
time. Such a fight for places! I managed to secure bow, which is a long
way the best seat, as you lead the procession. Everybody sees you first,
and it is most important that the crew should create a good impression.
Henrietta wanted the position, and said that her brother had told her
that the lightest girl should always be bow. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a> </span> replied "quite right,
and as I had lighter hair than hers, and my eyes were blue and hers
brown, of course it should be me." Fanny and Rose agreed with me, and
Kate (who was annoyed at not being consulted enough) placed her five.
Henrietta was in such a rage!</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;We are in training! Think it rather nonsense. Why should we
give up <i>meringues</i> and sponge-cakes? And as to cigarettes, that isn't
really a privation, as none of us really like them. A mile's run isn't
bad, but it wears out one's shoes terribly. Kate wanted us all to drink
stout, but we refused. We have compromised it by taking <i>fleur d'orange</i>
mixed with soda-water instead. The Turkish bath is rather long, but you
can read a novel after the douche. Take it altogether, perhaps training
is rather fun. Still, I think it, as I have already said, nonsense,
especially in regard to sponge-cakes and <i>meringues</i>.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Spent the whole of the morning in practising starts.
Everybody disagreeable&mdash;Kate absolutely rude. Fancy wanting me to put
down my parasol! And then Henrietta (spiteful creature!) declaring that
I didn't keep my eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a> </span> on the steering (we have lost our coxswain&mdash;had to
pay a visit to some people in the country) because I <i>would</i> look at the
people on the banks! And Kate backing her up! I was very angry indeed.
So I didn't come to practice in the afternoon, saying I had a bad
headache, and went instead to Flora's five o'clock tea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;The day of the race! Everybody in great spirits, and
looking their best. Even Henrietta was nice. Our picture-hats were
perfectly beautiful. Fanny came out with additional feathers, which
wasn't quite fair. But she said, as she was "stroke" she ought to be
different from the rest. And as it was too late to have the hat altered
we submitted. We started, and got on beautifully. I saw lots of people I
knew on the towing-path, and waved to them. And just because I dropped
hold of my oar as we got within ten yards of the winning-post they all
said it was <i>my</i> fault we lost! Who ever heard the like? The crew are a
spiteful set of ugly frumps, and on my solemn word I won't row any more.
Yes, it's no use asking me, as I say I won't, and I will stick to it.
There!</p>

<h2>A QUIET DAY ON THE THAMES</h2>

<center>(<i>Dedicated to the Thames Conservancy</i>)</center>

<p>9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Got out my boat, and made immediately for the centre of the
stream.</p>

<p>10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Spent some three-quarters of an hour in attempting to avoid the
swell of the City steamboats. Within an ace of being swamped by one of
them.</p>

<p>11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Run into by a sailing-barge. Only saved by holding on to a
rope, and pushing my boat aground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">12 noon.</span>&mdash;Aground.</p>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;After getting into deep water again, was immediately run into by
a coal-barge. Exchange of compliments with the crew thereof.</p>

<p>2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Pursued by swans and other savage birds. Pelted with stones
thrown from the shore by ragged urchins out of reach of my vengeance.</p>

<p>3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Amongst the fishing-punts. Lively communication of opinions by
the angry fishermen. Attempted piracy.</p>

<p>4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Busily engaged in extricating my boat from the weeds.</p>

<p>5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Disaster caused by a rope coming from the towing-path.</p>

<h2>THE TOURIST'S BAROMETER</h2>

<center>(<i>Read on the Channel</i>)</center>

<h4>Splendid Weather.</h4>
<p>I never mind the sea myself. The rougher for me the better. Have a cigar?</p>

<h4>Very Fine.</h4>
<p>One certainly does feel that only Englishmen can be sailors. Somehow or other
they take naturally to the sea&mdash;now, don't they?</p>

<h4>Fine.</h4>
<p>Yes. I always come by
Folkestone. I never <i>could</i> see the use of the <i>Castalia</i>.
We are not foreigners, you know. Most of us have our
sea-legs. Eh?</p>

<h4>Moderate.</h4>
<p>Yes. Perhaps a little brandy-and-water <i>would</i> be a good thing.</p>

<h4>Sea slight.</h4>
<p><i>very</i> roughest passage I remember. But I am an excellent sailor. Still,
would you mind putting out that cigar?</p>

<h4>Rather Rough.</h4>
<p>It's simply disgraceful. The  <i>Castalia</i> ought to be established
by Act of Parliament. Shall write to the <i>Times</i>.
I shall go down below&mdash;to think about it!</p>

<h4>Rough</h4>
<p>Oh! Here, somebody! Will it be more&mdash;than five minutes? Oh! oh! oh!</p>

<h4>Very Rough.</h4>

<p><i>He.</i> Perfectly charming. So nice after the heat.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, and really, everything has been delightful.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Couldn't possibly be better. Wonderful how well it can be done.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes. But, of course, it wants management. You know a lot comes
down from town.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Will the stores send so far?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, and if they won't others will. And then the local
tradespeople are very obliging.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But don't the servants rather kick at it?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> No, because they are comfortable enough. Put them up in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Ah, to be sure. And your brother looks after the cellar so well.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, he is quite a genius in that line.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a> </span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> And it's awfully nice chatting all day.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, when one doesn't go to sleep.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And, of course, we can fall back upon the circulating libraries
and the newspapers.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And so much better than town. It must be absolutely ghastly in
Piccadilly.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Yes, so I hear. And then there's the racing!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Ah, to be sure. To tell the truth, I didn't notice that very
much. Was there any winning?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, yes, a lot. But I really quite forget what&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, never mind. We can read all about it in to-morrow's papers,
and that will be better than bothering about it now.</p>

<h2>HENLEY REGATTA</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Oarsman</i>)</center>

<p>Sir,&mdash;This letter is private and is not intended for publication. I
particularly beg that you will note this, as on a former occasion some
remarks of mine, which were intended only for your private eye, were
printed. I of course accepted your assurance that no offence was meant,
and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a> </span> oversight was due to a person whose services had since the
occurrence been dispensed with; but I look to you to take care that it
shall not happen again. Otherwise the mutual confidence that should
always exist between an editor and his staff cannot possibly be
maintained, and I shall have to transfer my invaluable services to some
other paper. The notes and prognostications which I have laboriously
compiled with regard to the final results of the regatta will arrive by
the next post, and will, I flatter myself, be found to be
extraordinarily accurate, besides being written in that vivid and
picturesque style which has made my contributions famous throughout the
civilised world.</p>

<p>There are one or two little matters about which I honestly desire to
have your opinion. You know perfectly well that I was by no means
anxious for the position of aquatic reporter. In vain I pointed out to
you that my experience of the river was entirely limited to an
occasional trip by steamboat from Charing Cross to Gravesend. You said
that was an amply sufficient qualification, and that no aquatic reporter
who respected himself and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a> </span> readers, had ever so far degraded himself
as to row in a boat and to place his body in any of the absurd positions
which modern oarsmanship demands. Finding you were inexorable, and
knowing your ridiculously hasty temper, I consented finally to undertake
the arduous duties. These circumstances, however, make it essential that
you should give me advice when I require it. For obvious reasons I don't
much like to ask any of the rowing men here any questions. They are
mostly in what they call hard training, which means, I fancy, a
condition of high irritability. Their strokes may be long, but their
tempers are, I regret to say, painfully short. Besides, to be candid, I
don't wish to show the least trace of ignorance. My position demands
that I should be omniscient, and omniscient, to all outward appearance,
I shall remain.</p>

<p>In the first place, what is a "lightship"? As I travelled down to Henley
I read in one of the newspapers that "practice for the Royal Regatta was
now in full swing, and that the river was dotted with lightships of
every description." I remember some years ago passing a very pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a> </span>
half hour on board of a lightship moored in the neighbourhood of
Broadstairs. The rum was excellent. I looked forward with a lively
pleasure to repeating the experience at Henley. As soon as I arrived,
therefore, I put on my yachting cap (white, with a gold anchor
embroidered in front), hired a boat and a small boy, and directed him to
row me immediately to one of the lightships. I spent at least two hours
on the river in company with that boy&mdash;a very impudent little
fellow,&mdash;but owing no doubt to his stupidity, I failed to find a single
vessel which could be fairly described as a lightship. Finally the boy
said they had all been sunk in yesterday's great storm, and with that
inadequate explanation I was forced to content myself. But there is a
mystery about this. Please explain it.</p>

<p>Secondly, I see placards and advertisements all over the place
announcing that "the Stewards Stand." Now this fairly beats me. Why
should the stewards stand? They are presumably men of a certain age,
some of them must be of a certain corpulence, and it seems to me a
refinement of cruelty that these faithful officials, of whom, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a> </span>
believe, the respected Mayor of Henley is one, should be compelled to
refrain from seats during the whole of the Regatta. It may be necessary
for them to set an example of true British endurance to the crowds who
attend the Regatta, but in that case surely they ought to be paid for
the performance of their duties.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I have heard a good deal of talk about the Visitors' Cup. Being
anxious to test its merits, I went to one of the principal hotels here,
and ordered the waiter to bring me a quart of Visitors' Cup, and to be
careful to ice it well. He seemed puzzled, but went away to execute my
orders. After an absence of ten minutes he returned, and informed me,
with the manager's compliments, that they could not provide me with what
I wanted, but that their champagne-cup was excellent. I gave the fellow
a look, and departed. Perhaps this is only another example of the
asinine and anserous dunderheadedness of these crass provincials. Kindly
reply, <i>by wire</i>, about all the three points I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I have been here for a week, but have, as yet, not been fortunate enough
to see any crews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a> </span> Indeed, I doubt if there are any here. A good many
maniacs disport themselves every day in rickety things which look
something like gigantic needles, and other people have been riding along
the bank, and, very naturally, abusing them loudly for their foolhardy
recklessness. But no amount of abuse causes them to desist. I have
puzzled my brains to know what it all means, but I confess I can't make
it out. I fancy I know a boat when I see one, and of course these
ridiculous affairs can't be boats.</p>

<p>Be good enough to send me, by return, at least £100. It's a very
difficult and expensive thing to support the dignity of your paper in
this town. Whiskey is very dear, and a great deal goes a very short way.</p>

<h2>FLITTINGS</h2>

<center>(<i>Per Ocean Bottle-post</i>)</center>

<p class="regards">
<i>In the South Atlantic,<br />
Three miles off Land (perpendicularly).<br />
Six Bells, Feb. 27, 1898.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span>&mdash;Yeo-ho and ahoy! If this ever reaches you, it is to
tell you that the very good ship <i>Triton</i> (this is within a cable's
length of her name) has been at sea for just a fortnight, bound for the
Cape on her second trip. She bears on board about a thousand souls all
told, five horses, a couple of cows, two or three parrots, of
third-class behaviour, and a few canaries, which have not as yet taken
berths inside the ship's cat.</p>

<p>We left Southampton on an even keel, but there were plenty of French
rolls for breakfast next morning in the Bay of Biscay, so we were
ægrotat (<i>sic</i>) for the rest of the day in such seclusion as our cabin
granted. The next event of importance was Madeira. Here we had about
four hours in which to watch the natives (one of them a one-armed boy)
diving for our spare coppers, to breakfast on shore, to do the sights of
Funchal, to buy deck-chairs, if not whole drawing-room suites, of
wickerwork, to visit Santa Clara and the other suburban resorts, and,
most necessary of all, to ascend by the new mountain railway to the
church of Nossa Senhora de Monte, and then to descend two thousand feet
by <i>carro</i>, or toboggan over the cobble-stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a> </span> pathway. It was a lot to
do, but we did it on our heads&mdash;especially the last-named athletic
performance. Our steersman, Manuel, certainly deserved his pint of
Madeira at the "Half-way House" for his agility and dexterity in taking
us down a decline of one in two, past corkscrew corners, and hordes of
beggars.</p>

<p>English money seems to be quite the medium of currency at Funchal, and
English is spoken by the enterprising islanders while you wait (or until
your last shilling is spent). Even a tea-garden sort of place is
dignified by the name of "Earl's Court," to attract and solace the
homesick Londoner. Meanwhile, it was market-day on board the ship, and
great was the company of merchants with all kinds of wares. These are
bundled off neck and crop by 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and we settled down to the serious
business of the voyage&mdash;the election of a Sports and Entertainment
Committee, the consumption of six meals a day, the daily sweepstakes and
auction on the run, the dissection of everybody's character, and the
other inevitable humours and incidents of an ocean trip.</p>

<p>We fetched a compass, or whatever the nautical phrase is, round the
Canaries in a sea-fog, for fear of running up against Teneriffe, and
since then we haven't sighted land, nor seen a ship, or even a whale or
waterspout, nothing more exciting than a few coveys of flying-fish, and,
I think, half-a-dozen porpoises. At the moment of writing, however, I
see a solitary albatross, and lose no time in informing your readers of
the fact. We crossed the line without feeling the slightest bump. We
have passed through the tropics with only one hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a> </span> night, and our feet,
like our thoughts, are now turning towards Fleet Street and home, as we
near the Antipodes.</p>

<p>We have had the usual fancy-dress ball with some decidedly impromptu
costumes. One of a large theatrical company was quite unrecognisable as
Sheffield's Ape, taking the first prize, and has since been busy
restoring himself to human form. The captain's clerk appeared in a
series of quick-turn changes, such as a comic sailor or a deplorable old
lady; while the ship's doctor contributed an awe-inspiring impersonation
of Old Moore or somebody in the wizard profession.</p>

<p>The sports and other entertainments have passed off without bloodshed.
Our captain, a breezy, jovial Irishman, received the ladies with open
arms at the finish of their fifty yards race, and the comedians who
performed in "Are you there?" and the other humorous items fully rose,
or tumbled, to the occasion, as the case might be. Take it all round, we
have had a particularly good time of it. Pleasant company and pleasant
weather. Out of reach of letters and telegrams, and face to face with
the ocean.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a> </span></p>

<p>We are now in the teeth of a strong south-easter, and the writing-room
is beginning to dance, I therefore hasten to catch the post.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic boating man, who, however, prefers luncheon when the

kid-gloves and high top-boots.</p>

<p>The calm mathematician (from Berlin), who would prefer to see the races
represented by an equation.</p>

<p>The cute Yankee (from New York), who is quite sure that some of the

<p>Launches: steam, electric, accommodating and the reverse.</p>

<p>Men in flannels who don't boat, and men in tweeds who do.</p>

<p>A vast multitude residential, and a vaster come per rail from town.</p>

<p>Three glorious days of excellent racing, at once national and unique.</p>

<p>An aquatic festival, a pattern to the world.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> "Isn't it jolly to think we have the whole day before us? The
boatman says we couldn't go home, even if we wanted to, till the tide
turns, and that's not for hours and hours yet. I've got all sorts of
lovely things for lunch too!"</p>

<h2>HINTS FOR HENLEY</h2>

<p>Flannels in moderation are pardonable, but they are slightly out of
place if you can't row and it rains.</p>

<p>The cuisine of a houseboat is not always limitless, so "chance" visitors
are sometimes more numerous than welcome.</p>

<p>The humours of burnt-cork minstrelsy must be tolerated during an aquatic
carnival, but it is as well to give street singers as wide a berth as
possible.</p>

<p>In the selection of guests for, say, <i>The Pearl of the North Pole</i>, or
<i>The Hushaby Baby</i>, it is as well to learn that none of them are cuts
with the others, and all are prepared to accept "roughing it" as the
order of the day.</p>

<p>Lanterns, music, and fireworks are extremely pretty things, but night
air on the river is sometimes an introduction to sciatica, rheumatism,
and chills.</p>

<p>In the selection of a costume, a lady should remember that it is good to
be "smart," but better still to be well.</p>

<p>Finally, it is desirable to bear in mind that, pleasant as riparian life
may be, Henley is, after all, a regatta, and that consequently some sort
of attention should be paid to the racing.</p>

<h3>GASTRONOMERS AFLOAT</h3>
<p><i>Mrs. Fleshpottle.</i> "Well, I must say, Mrs. Gumblewag, I like something
substantial for <i>my</i> dinner. Nothing, I think, can be better than some
pea-soup to begin with; then a biled leg of mutton with plenty of fat,
with turnips and caper sauce; then some tripe and onions, and one or two
nice suet dumplings as a finish!"</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Gumblewag.</i> "For my part, mum, I prefer something more tasty and
flavoursome-like. Now, a well-cooked bullock's heart, to be followed by
some liver and bacon, and a dish of greens. Afterwards a jam bolster,
and a black pudding, and some toasted cheese to top up with, is what I
call a dinner fit for a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<h2>MORE HINTS FOR HENLEY</h2>

<center>(<i>For the use of Visitors, Male and Female</i>)</center>

<p>Take an umbrella to keep off the rain&mdash;unopened.</p>

<p>Beware of encouraging burnt-cork minstrels, or incurring their
resentment.</p>

<p>Remember, it is not every houseboat that is sufficiently hospitable to
afford lunch.</p>

<p>After all, a travel down from town in the train is better than the
discomforts of dawn on the river in a houseboat.</p>

<p>Six hours of enforced company is a strong order for the best of friends,
sometimes leading to incipient enmity.</p>

<p>A canoe for two is a pleasant distraction if the man is equal to keeping
from an upset in the water.</p>

<p>Flirting is a not unpleasant accompaniment to an <i>alfresco</i> lunch with
well-iced liquids.</p>

<p>If you really wish to make a favourable impression upon everyone, be
cheery, contented, good-natured, and, above all, slightly interested in
the racing.</p>

<h2>FURTHER REGULATIONS FOR HENLEY</h2>

<center>(<i>Under the Consideration of the Thames Conservancy</i>)</center>

<p>No piano playing shall be permitted on houseboats during the racing, so
that the attention of coxswains shall not be thereby distracted.</p>

<p>To avoid a crowd collecting on the course, no craft shall be permitted
to leave the shores between the hours of 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>To preserve decorum, only lemonade and ginger-beer shall be drunk during
the illuminations, and fireworks shall henceforth be restricted to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a> </span>
squib and a couple of crackers to each houseboat.</p>

<p>Finally, recreation of every kind shall be discontinued, so that in
future the unpopularity of the County Council on land shall find its
reflection in the universal detestation in which the Thames Conservancy
shall be held by those living on the river.</p>

<p><i>Extract from Diary.</i>&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span> Went for a spin or trip, or whatever
it's called, on Bowlines' new racing yacht. Felt very nervous when we
turned the corners; nearly fell overboard while I was trying to balance
the thing; thought we should have been drowned. B. said it was a wonder
we weren't&mdash;thanks to <i>me</i>! Had a few words with B. <i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Never
again!"</p>
